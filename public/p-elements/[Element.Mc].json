{"description":"Moscovium is a synthetic element named after the Moscow region, recognizing longstanding contributions to nuclear research. It is produced in extremely small quantities and decays in less than a second. Moscovium is predicted to behave like bismuth, though with significant relativistic effects that alter bonding. Its importance lies in expanding the periodic table and testing nuclear theories related to superheavy stability. Like its neighbors, moscovium is relevant only within advanced scientific research.","name":"Moscovium","symbol":"Mc","atomicNumber":"115","period":"7","group":"15","atomicMass":"290 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p³","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,5],"densityRT":"~13.5 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~400 °C","boilingPointC":"~1 100 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

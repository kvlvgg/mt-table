{"description":"Indium is a soft, malleable metal used in touchscreens, solar panels, and specialized electronics. Its ability to form transparent conductive films makes it essential for modern displays. Indium also appears in solders, semiconductors, and low-melting alloys. Although relatively rare, it is typically recovered as a byproduct of zinc processing. Its contributions to electronics ensure steady demand despite limited supplies.","name":"Indium","symbol":"In","atomicNumber":"49","period":"5","group":"13","atomicMass":"114.818 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18,3],"densityRT":"7.31 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"7.02 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"156.6 °C","boilingPointC":"2 072 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.74 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"15.7 cm³/mol"}

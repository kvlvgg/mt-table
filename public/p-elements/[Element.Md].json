{"description":"Mendelevium, named after Dmitri Mendeleev, is a synthetic element created through particle bombardment. It exists only in microscopic amounts, restricting its study to highly specialized laboratories. Mendelevium’s radioactive nature and low production rates make its chemistry difficult to analyze, though researchers have confirmed several oxidation states typical of late actinides. Its primary purpose is to support the synthesis and exploration of heavier elements. While it has no commercial applications, mendelevium is important for expanding the periodic table and refining models of atomic stability. Its existence highlights the ongoing effort to explore matter at the edge of nuclear possibility.","name":"Mendelevium","symbol":"Md","atomicNumber":"101","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"258 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹³ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,31,8,2],"densityRT":"~10.3 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~827 °C","boilingPointC":"— °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~25 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"~23 cm³/mol"}

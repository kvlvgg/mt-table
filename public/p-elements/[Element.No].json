{"description":"Nobelium is a synthetic, intensely radioactive actinide named in honor of Alfred Nobel. It is produced in particle accelerators through fusion reactions, yielding only a few atoms at a time. These limitations make stable experimentation difficult, but scientists have established its predominant oxidation states and chemical tendencies. Nobelium contributes to theoretical studies on nuclear structure and electron interactions in superheavy atoms. Although not useful outside research, it plays a significant role in understanding the behavior of elements near the end of the actinide series. Its discovery reflects major advances in experimental nuclear chemistry.","name":"Nobelium","symbol":"No","atomicNumber":"102","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"259 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,8,2],"densityRT":"~9.9 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"827 °C","boilingPointC":"— °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~25 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"~24 cm³/mol"}

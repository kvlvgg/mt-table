{"description":"Bismuth is a brittle, silvery metal with a distinctive iridescent oxidation pattern. It is one of the least toxic heavy metals, often used as a safer substitute for lead in alloys and solders. Bismuth’s unique physical properties—such as expanding when it freezes—make it valuable in precision casting. In pharmaceuticals, it appears in certain stomach-relief medicines in the form of non-reactive compounds. Its low thermal conductivity and high diamagnetism provide opportunities for scientific experimentation. Although not abundant, bismuth’s niche uses span metallurgy, cosmetics, and research. Its gentle chemical behavior sets it apart from other heavy metals historically known for toxicity.","name":"Bismuth","symbol":"Bi","atomicNumber":"83","period":"6","group":"15","atomicMass":"208.98 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p³","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,5],"densityRT":"9.78 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"10.05 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"271.4 °C","boilingPointC":"1 564 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.52 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"21.31 cm³/mol"}

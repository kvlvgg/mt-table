{"description":"Selenium is a nonmetal with important roles in electronics, glassmaking, and biology. It improves glass clarity, helps control metallurgical processes, and appears in photocells due to its light sensitivity. In small amounts, selenium is essential for human metabolism, though high levels can be harmful. Its ability to interact with light and electricity makes selenium useful in specialized devices and technologies.","name":"Selenium","symbol":"Se","atomicNumber":"34","period":"4","group":"16","atomicMass":"78.971 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁴","energyLevels":[2,8,18,6],"densityRT":"4.79 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"221 °C","boilingPointC":"685 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.36 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"16.5 cm³/mol"}

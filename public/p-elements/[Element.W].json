{"description":"Tungsten is an exceptionally dense and heat-resistant metal known for having one of the highest melting points of any element. It is used in cutting tools, electrical contacts, and high-temperature applications such as rocket-engine parts. Tungsten also appears in lighting and radiation shielding. Its extreme durability and stability under heat make it indispensable in heavy industry.","name":"Tungsten","symbol":"W","atomicNumber":"74","period":"6","group":"6","atomicMass":"183.84 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d⁴ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,12,2],"densityRT":"19.25 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"3 422 °C","boilingPointC":"5 555 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.27 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"9.53 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Manganese is a tough, brittle metal essential for producing high-strength steel. It improves hardness, durability, and resistance to wear, making it indispensable in construction and heavy machinery. Manganese is also important in batteries, fertilizers, and chemical catalysts. In biology, trace amounts support enzyme function and metabolic processes. Its combination of industrial importance and biological relevance makes manganese a widely studied and applied element.","name":"Manganese","symbol":"Mn","atomicNumber":"25","period":"4","group":"7","atomicMass":"54.938 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,13,2],"densityRT":"7.21 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"5.95 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 246 °C","boilingPointC":"2 061 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.3 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"7.4 cm³/mol"}

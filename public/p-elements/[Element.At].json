{"description":"Astatine is one of the rarest elements on Earth, existing naturally only in trace amounts due to its short-lived radioactivity. Its properties are not fully understood, but it is generally considered a halogen with some metallic tendencies. Researchers study astatine primarily for its potential in targeted cancer therapies, where short-range radiation can damage diseased cells with high precision. Because it decays rapidly, astatine must be produced on demand in particle accelerators for experimental use. Although its chemistry remains difficult to explore, astatine offers promising pathways for innovative medical treatments and deeper insights into radioactive halogen behavior."}

{"description":"Flerovium is a synthetic superheavy element named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. It displays unusual predicted properties, including potential semi-metallic or inert behavior. Experiments suggest it may be less reactive than expected, possibly approaching noble-gas-like characteristics. Flerovium plays an important role in exploring the “island of stability,” where certain superheavy nuclei might exhibit longer lifetimes. Its chemistry challenges established periodic trends and helps refine quantum models of heavy atoms.","name":"Flerovium","symbol":"Fl","atomicNumber":"114","period":"7","group":"14","atomicMass":"289 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,4],"densityRT":"~14 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~70 °C","boilingPointC":"~150 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

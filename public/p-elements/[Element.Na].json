{"description":"Sodium is a soft, highly reactive metal that forms a wide variety of useful compounds. While pure sodium reacts vigorously with water, its salts—such as sodium chloride—are stable and essential in biology and industry. Sodium compounds appear in detergents, glass manufacturing, and chemical processing. In biology, sodium ions regulate fluid balance and nerve impulses. Because of its reactivity, metallic sodium requires careful storage, but its compounds remain indispensable across many fields.","name":"Sodium","symbol":"Na","atomicNumber":"11","period":"3","group":"1","atomicMass":"22.990 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ne] 3s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,1],"densityRT":"0.968 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.927 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"97.8 °C","boilingPointC":"883 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"28.2 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"23.7 cm³/mol"}

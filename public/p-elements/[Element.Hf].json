{"description":"Hafnium is a corrosion-resistant metal often paired with zirconium due to their similar properties. It is used in nuclear reactors, high-temperature alloys, and semiconductor manufacturing. Hafnium improves turbine blade durability and forms reliable insulating layers in microchips. Its stability at extreme temperatures makes it valuable in demanding engineering environments.","name":"Hafnium","symbol":"Hf","atomicNumber":"72","period":"6","group":"4","atomicMass":"178.49 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d² 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,10,2],"densityRT":"13.31 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"2 233 °C","boilingPointC":"4 603 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.73 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"13.41 cm³/mol"}

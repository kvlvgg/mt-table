{"description":"Darmstadtium is a synthetic, extremely short-lived metal discovered in Darmstadt, Germany. Its isotopes decay rapidly, offering little time for chemical investigation. Theoretical work suggests it behaves similarly to platinum, but experimental confirmation is limited. Darmstadtium helps scientists probe the “island of stability” and understand how superheavy atoms form and decay. It serves no industrial purpose, but it remains important for advancing nuclear chemistry and refining theoretical models of atomic behavior.","name":"Darmstadtium","symbol":"Ds","atomicNumber":"110","period":"7","group":"10","atomicMass":"281 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d⁹ 7s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,17,1],"densityRT":"~34 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 400 °C","boilingPointC":"~7 000 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

{"description":"Tennessine is a synthetic halogen named after the state of Tennessee. It is expected to share some behavior with astatine, though relativistic effects may soften its reactivity compared to lighter halogens. Only a few atoms have ever been synthesized, each decaying within fractions of a second. Tennessine provides insight into heavy p-block chemistry and pushes the boundaries of experimental nuclear science. It remains important for understanding how far halogen-like behavior extends in the superheavy region.","name":"Tennessine","symbol":"Ts","atomicNumber":"117","period":"7","group":"17","atomicMass":"294 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p⁵","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,7],"densityRT":"~7.2 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~350 °C","boilingPointC":"~610 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"~41 cm³/mol"}

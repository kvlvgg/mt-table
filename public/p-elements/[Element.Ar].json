{"description":"Argon is an inert noble gas commonly used to create protective atmospheres in welding, metallurgy, and electronics. Because it does not react with other elements, argon prevents oxidation and contamination in sensitive processes. It is also used in lighting and as a filling gas for insulated windows. Despite being chemically inactive, argon’s stability makes it a practical and widely applied resource in manufacturing and construction.","name":"Argon","symbol":"Ar","atomicNumber":"18","period":"3","group":"18","atomicMass":"39.948 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ne] 3s² 3p⁶","energyLevels":[2,8,8],"densityRT":"0.001784 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.40 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-189.3 °C","boilingPointC":"-185.8 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"20.8 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"22.4 cm³/mol"}

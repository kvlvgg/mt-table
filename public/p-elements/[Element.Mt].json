{"description":"Meitnerium is a synthetic element named after physicist Lise Meitner. Only a few atoms have ever been produced, each decaying within milliseconds. Its chemical properties are largely theoretical, expected to resemble those of iridium. Meitnerium is used exclusively in research aimed at understanding superheavy nuclei and the extension of periodic trends. Though impractical outside laboratory settings, it symbolizes scientific progress in creating and studying elements that exist only momentarily.","name":"Meitnerium","symbol":"Mt","atomicNumber":"109","period":"7","group":"9","atomicMass":"278 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d⁷ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,15,2],"densityRT":"~37 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 400 °C","boilingPointC":"~7 000 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

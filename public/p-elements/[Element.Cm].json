{"description":"Curium is a synthetic actinide created in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. It exhibits strong radioactivity and is primarily used in scientific research, particularly in studying nuclear reactions and heavy-element chemistry. Some curium isotopes serve as heat sources in space exploration equipment, though production is expensive. Curium’s chemical behavior helps scientists better understand the upper actinides, providing insight into electron interactions in heavy atoms. Because of its radiological hazards, curium is handled only in specialized facilities. Although it has no widespread industrial uses, it remains important to nuclear science, isotope production, and experiments exploring the limits of elemental stability.","name":"Curium","symbol":"Cm","atomicNumber":"96","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"247 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f⁷ 6d¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,25,9,2],"densityRT":"13.51 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~12.5 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 340 °C","boilingPointC":"3 110 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.0 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"18.3 cm³/mol"}

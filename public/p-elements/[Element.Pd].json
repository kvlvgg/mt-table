{"description":"Palladium is a precious metal widely used in catalytic converters, electronics, and hydrogen purification. Its ability to absorb hydrogen makes it unique among metals. Palladium is also essential in multilayer ceramic capacitors and various chemical reactions. Though often compared to platinum, palladium offers distinct advantages in energy storage and catalysis. Its scarcity and high demand make it one of the most valuable industrial metals.","name":"Palladium","symbol":"Pd","atomicNumber":"46","period":"5","group":"10","atomicMass":"106.42 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹⁰","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18],"densityRT":"12.02 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"1 554.9 °C","boilingPointC":"2 963 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.98 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"8.9 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Iridium is one of the most corrosion-resistant metals, used in electrical contacts, spark plugs, and deep-sea or space-grade equipment. It withstands extreme environments and maintains structural integrity under heat and chemical exposure. Iridium also forms long-lasting alloys and supports scientific instruments. Though rare, its durability makes it crucial for high-reliability systems.","name":"Iridium","symbol":"Ir","atomicNumber":"77","period":"6","group":"9","atomicMass":"192.22 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d⁷ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,15,2],"densityRT":"22.56 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"2 446 °C","boilingPointC":"4 428 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.10 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"8.54 cm³/mol"}

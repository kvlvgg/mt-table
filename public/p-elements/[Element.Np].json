{"description":"Neptunium is a synthetic actinide formed during nuclear reactions, though small amounts occur naturally in uranium ores. It exhibits several oxidation states, making its chemistry varied and scientifically important. Neptunium is mainly used in research on nuclear fuels and radioactive decay. Some of its isotopes can be converted into plutonium, linking it to fuel cycle studies and waste management strategies. While too radioactive and scarce for industrial use, neptunium helps scientists better understand transuranic behavior and long-term nuclear material stability. Its role is closely tied to reactor technology, environmental monitoring, and the development of safer nuclear processes.","name":"Neptunium","symbol":"Np","atomicNumber":"93","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"237 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f⁴ 6d¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,22,9,2],"densityRT":"20.45 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~19.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"640 °C","boilingPointC":"3 902 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"29.5 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"11.6 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Cesium is a soft, golden metal notable for its extreme reactivity and low melting point. It is essential in atomic clocks, which rely on its precise frequency standards. Cesium also appears in sensors, vacuum tubes, and scientific research. Because of its reactivity with air and water, cesium must be stored carefully. Despite these challenges, its precision and unique properties make it valuable in high-accuracy applications.","name":"Cesium","symbol":"Cs","atomicNumber":"55","period":"6","group":"1","atomicMass":"132.91 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 6s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18,8,1],"densityRT":"1.93 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"28.5 °C","boilingPointC":"671 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"32.21 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"71.07 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Chromium is a shiny, corrosion-resistant metal widely used for protective coatings and stainless steel production. Its oxide layer prevents rust and gives chromium its distinctive reflective finish. Chromium compounds are essential in pigments, metal plating, and leather tanning. Although some forms can be hazardous, controlled industrial use ensures safety. With its ability to improve hardness and durability, chromium remains a cornerstone of materials science and manufacturing.","name":"Chromium","symbol":"Cr","atomicNumber":"24","period":"4","group":"6","atomicMass":"51.996 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,13,1],"densityRT":"7.19 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"6.30 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 907 °C","boilingPointC":"2 671 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"23.4 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"7.2 cm³/mol"}

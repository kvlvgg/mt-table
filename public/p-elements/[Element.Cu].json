{"description":"Copper is a reddish metal known for its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is essential in wiring, electronics, plumbing, and renewable-energy systems. Copper’s antimicrobial properties also support uses in healthcare and sanitation. As one of the first metals used by humans, it remains central to modern technology. Although it oxidizes over time, forming a green patina, this coating protects the underlying metal, ensuring long-term durability.","name":"Copper","symbol":"Cu","atomicNumber":"29","period":"4","group":"11","atomicMass":"63.546 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,1],"densityRT":"8.96 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"8.02 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 084.6 °C","boilingPointC":"2 562 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.4 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"7.1 cm³/mol"}

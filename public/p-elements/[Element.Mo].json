{"description":"Molybdenum is a strong, heat-resistant metal essential for high-strength steels and alloys. It improves hardness, corrosion resistance, and stability at high temperatures. Molybdenum is critical in power plants, chemical processing equipment, and industrial tools. In biology, trace amounts help support enzyme function. Its ability to perform in extreme environments makes molybdenum a valuable resource in both heavy industry and advanced engineering.","name":"Molybdenum","symbol":"Mo","atomicNumber":"42","period":"5","group":"6","atomicMass":"95.95 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d⁵ 5s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,13,1],"densityRT":"10.28 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"9.33 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"2 623 °C","boilingPointC":"4 639 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.06 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"9.4 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Zirconium is a corrosion-resistant metal widely used in nuclear reactors, chemical processing, and high-temperature materials. Its resistance to corrosion and heat makes it ideal for environments where stability is critical. Zirconium alloys are used in reactors because they do not absorb neutrons easily. The metal also appears in surgical tools and specialized coatings. Despite being difficult to refine, zirconium remains essential for demanding engineering applications.","name":"Zirconium","symbol":"Zr","atomicNumber":"40","period":"5","group":"4","atomicMass":"91.224 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d² 5s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,10,2],"densityRT":"6.52 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"5.8 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 855 °C","boilingPointC":"4 409 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.36 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"14.0 cm³/mol"}

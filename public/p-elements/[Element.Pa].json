{"description":"Protactinium is a rare, highly radioactive actinide with limited practical applications due to its scarcity and toxicity. It is typically obtained as a byproduct of uranium processing and used primarily in scientific research. Protactinium’s complex chemistry helps scientists understand the behavior of heavy elements, particularly the transition between actinides. Historically, it was important in early nuclear studies, though safety concerns restrict its use today. Its isotopes contribute valuable data to nuclear physics, decay modeling, and material science. While not useful industrially, protactinium remains relevant in specialized laboratories that investigate the properties of elements at the upper end of the periodic table.","name":"Protactinium","symbol":"Pa","atomicNumber":"91","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"231.0359 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f² 6d¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,20,9,2],"densityRT":"15.37 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~14.7 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 568 °C","boilingPointC":"4 027 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"28.0 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"15.0 cm³/mol"}

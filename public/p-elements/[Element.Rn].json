{"description":"Radon is a radioactive noble gas formed naturally from the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. It can accumulate in enclosed spaces, posing a health risk due to lung cancer associated with long-term exposure. Radon is colorless, odorless, and chemically inert, making it difficult to detect without specialized instruments. Despite its dangers, radon has niche applications in geological research and certain medical treatments. Monitoring indoor radon levels is an important part of environmental safety in many regions. Understanding its movement through the ground also helps scientists study seismic activity and the behavior of gases in the Earth’s crust.","name":"Radon","symbol":"Rn","atomicNumber":"86","period":"6","group":"18","atomicMass":"222 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p⁶","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,8],"densityRT":"0.00973 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"4.4 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-71 °C","boilingPointC":"-61.7 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"20.8","molarVolume":"50.⁵/undefined"}

{"description":"Uranium is a dense, silvery metal best known for its role in nuclear power and weapons. It naturally occurs in several isotopes, with uranium-235 being crucial for sustaining nuclear chain reactions. Beyond energy production, uranium has applications in glass coloring, radiation shielding, and scientific instrumentation. Its chemistry is diverse, forming many compounds that influence environmental and geological processes. Handling uranium requires proper safety protocols due to both its toxicity and radioactivity. Despite risks, uranium remains central to discussions about energy policy, sustainability, and global security. Its significance spans engineering, research, and long-term strategies for clean, large-scale power generation.","name":"Uranium","symbol":"U","atomicNumber":"92","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"238.0289 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f³ 6d¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,21,9,2],"densityRT":"19.1 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"17.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 132 °C","boilingPointC":"4 131 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.7 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"12.6 cm³/mol"}

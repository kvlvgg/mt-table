{"description":"Dubnium is a synthetic element produced in extremely small quantities. Its isotopes decay rapidly, restricting research to very short timeframes. Dubnium’s chemistry suggests parallels with tantalum and niobium, though relativistic effects may create subtle differences. Studying dubnium sheds light on how superheavy elements behave and how the periodic table extends beyond the actinides. It remains purely scientific in value, with no practical applications due to its scarcity and radioactivity. Continued experiments focus on confirming its predicted properties and refining nuclear models.","name":"Dubnium","symbol":"Db","atomicNumber":"105","period":"7","group":"5","atomicMass":"268 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d³ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,11,2],"densityRT":"~29 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 000 °C","boilingPointC":"~5 500 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

{"description":"Gallium is a soft, silvery metal that melts just above room temperature. It is widely used in semiconductors, LEDs, and high-frequency electronics. Gallium compounds such as gallium arsenide provide efficient energy conversion, making them important for laser diodes and solar cells. Though not abundant in nature, gallium is obtained as a byproduct of aluminum and zinc production. Its unique melting behavior and electronic properties make it valuable for advanced technologies.","name":"Gallium","symbol":"Ga","atomicNumber":"31","period":"4","group":"13","atomicMass":"69.723 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,3],"densityRT":"5.91 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"6.095 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"29.76 °C","boilingPointC":"2 204 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.86 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"11.8 cm³/mol"}

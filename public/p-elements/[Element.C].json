{"description":"Carbon is one of the most versatile elements, forming the backbone of organic chemistry and all known life. Its ability to create stable bonds allows for an immense diversity of molecules, from simple gases to complex biological structures. Carbon appears as graphite, diamond, fullerenes, and countless industrial materials. It plays a central role in energy cycles, fuels, and biochemical processes. Modern technologies use carbon in polymers, composites, filters, and electronic components. Its unique bonding behavior continues to make carbon one of the most studied and essential elements.","name":"Carbon","symbol":"C","atomicNumber":"6","period":"2","group":"14","atomicMass":"12.011 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p²","energyLevels":[2,4],"densityRT":"2.26 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~4 000 °C","boilingPointC":"4 827 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"8.5 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"5.3 cm³/mol"}

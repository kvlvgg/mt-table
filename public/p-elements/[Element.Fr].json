{"description":"Francium is an extremely rare and highly radioactive metal, with only microscopic amounts occurring naturally. Its short half-life makes it almost impossible to collect or study in bulk. Most knowledge about francium comes from theoretical predictions and small-scale experiments in particle accelerators. Chemically, it behaves like an alkali metal, though its intense radioactivity overwhelms its observable properties. Francium’s scarcity limits it to research focused on atomic structure and fundamental physics. While it has no practical applications, francium provides valuable insights into the stability of heavy elements and helps scientists refine models of atomic behavior near the limits of the periodic table.","name":"Francium","symbol":"Fr","atomicNumber":"87","period":"7","group":"1","atomicMass":"223 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 7s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,8,1],"densityRT":"~1.87 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~1.70 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"~27 °C","boilingPointC":"~677 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~25 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"~71 cm³/mol"}

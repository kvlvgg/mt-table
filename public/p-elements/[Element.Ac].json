{"description":"Actinium is a radioactive metal found in trace amounts in uranium ores and produced artificially for scientific work. It glows faintly due to its radioactivity and behaves chemically like other actinides. Actinium is used in targeted cancer therapy research, where its strong alpha emissions can help attack tumor cells. Strict safety measures are essential when working with it. Beyond medical studies, actinium contributes to understanding nuclear decay chains and heavy-element chemistry. Its rarity and high activity make it unsuitable for industrial use, but it serves as a valuable tool for advancing knowledge in nuclear science and radiopharmaceutical development.","name":"Actinium","symbol":"Ac","atomicNumber":"89","period":"7","group":"3","atomicMass":"227 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 6d¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,9,2],"densityRT":"10.07 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~9.6 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 050 °C","boilingPointC":"3 198 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.2 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"22.5 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Radium is a strongly radioactive alkaline-earth metal once used in luminous paints for watches and instruments. Its intense glow fascinated early researchers, though the severe health risks became evident over time. Today, radium’s applications are strictly controlled, appearing mainly in medical treatments and scientific studies. It decays into radon gas, requiring careful containment. Radium played an important historical role in the development of nuclear physics and radiation research. Although safer alternatives have replaced most of its early uses, radium remains a symbol of both scientific discovery and caution, illustrating the need for respect when working with radioactive materials.","name":"Radium","symbol":"Ra","atomicNumber":"88","period":"7","group":"2","atomicMass":"226 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,8,2],"densityRT":"5.5 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~5.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"700 °C","boilingPointC":"1 737 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.0 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"45.2 cm³/mol"}

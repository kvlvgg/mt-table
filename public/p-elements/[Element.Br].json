{"description":"Bromine is a dark, reddish-brown liquid at room temperature, notable for its reactivity and strong odor. It is used in flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, and photographic chemicals. Bromine compounds help reduce flammability in electronics and textiles. Because bromine can be hazardous, it requires careful handling and storage. Despite this, its versatility ensures continued use in modern manufacturing and chemical processes.","name":"Bromine","symbol":"Br","atomicNumber":"35","period":"4","group":"17","atomicMass":"79.904 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"A 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁵","energyLevels":[2,8,18,7],"densityRT":"3.12 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"3.12 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"–7.2 °C","boilingPointC":"58.8 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"75.69 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"23.5 cm³/mol"}

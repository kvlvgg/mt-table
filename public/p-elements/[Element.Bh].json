{"description":"Bohrium is a highly radioactive synthetic metal with extremely short-lived isotopes. Experimental work indicates that it behaves similarly to rhenium, though observing its chemistry requires complex, rapid techniques. Bohrium’s significance lies in verifying predicted periodic trends and exploring chemical behavior under intense relativistic influence. It has no commercial uses, as production is exceedingly difficult. Instead, bohrium supports ongoing efforts to map the properties of superheavy elements and understand the structure of the periodic table’s most elusive region.","name":"Bohrium","symbol":"Bh","atomicNumber":"107","period":"7","group":"7","atomicMass":"270 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d⁵ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,13,2],"densityRT":"~37 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 200 °C","boilingPointC":"~6 500 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

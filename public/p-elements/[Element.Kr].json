{"description":"Krypton is a noble gas valued for its bright white light in discharge tubes and high-performance lighting. It is used in lasers, photographic flashes, and insulating window fillings. Krypton’s inert nature makes it safe and stable for various applications. Although rare in Earth’s atmosphere, it is collected during air separation. Its clean, intense light output keeps krypton relevant in specialized illumination technologies.","name":"Krypton","symbol":"Kr","atomicNumber":"36","period":"4","group":"18","atomicMass":"83.798 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁶","energyLevels":[2,8,18,8],"densityRT":"0.003733 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"2.41 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"–157.4 °C","boilingPointC":"–153.4 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"20.95 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"27.0 cm³/mol"}

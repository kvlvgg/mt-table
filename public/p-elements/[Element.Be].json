{"description":"Beryllium is a hard, brittle metal with exceptional stiffness and a very low density. It forms strong alloys, especially with copper, used in precision instruments, aerospace components, and high-performance tools. Beryllium is transparent to X-rays, which makes it valuable in imaging equipment and scientific applications. However, its dust and fumes are toxic when inhaled, so strict safety controls are required during processing. Despite these hazards, beryllium’s unique combination of lightness, rigidity, and thermal stability ensures its continued use in advanced engineering fields where performance outweighs difficulty of handling.","name":"Beryllium","symbol":"Be","atomicNumber":"4","period":"2","group":"2","atomicMass":"9.0121831 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s²","energyLevels":[2,2],"densityRT":"1.85 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.69 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 287 °C","boilingPointC":"2 470 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"16.4 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"4.9 cm³/mol"}

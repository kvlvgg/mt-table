{"description":"Rubidium is a soft, reactive metal that ignites easily in air and reacts strongly with water. Despite its reactivity, rubidium has niche applications in electronics, atomic clocks, and research. It helps calibrate instruments and supports experiments involving atomic behavior. Although not widely used industrially, its properties make it valuable in scientific settings where precision is essential.","name":"Rubidium","symbol":"Rb","atomicNumber":"37","period":"5","group":"1","atomicMass":"85.468 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 5s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,8,1],"densityRT":"1.532 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.46 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"39.31 °C","boilingPointC":"688 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"31.06 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"55.8 cm³/mol"}

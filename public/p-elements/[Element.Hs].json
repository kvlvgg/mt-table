{"description":"Hassium is a synthetic metal named after the German state of Hesse. It exhibits brief but measurable chemical behavior, showing similarities to osmium. Hassium’s study is notable because it helped demonstrate that periodic trends continue—though with modifications—into the superheavy elements. Its isotopes are short-lived yet stable enough for controlled experiments using advanced detection methods. Hassium’s importance is purely scientific, providing insights into nuclear structure, bonding, and the role of relativistic effects. It remains one of the better-characterized transactinides despite its rarity.","name":"Hassium","symbol":"Hs","atomicNumber":"108","period":"7","group":"8","atomicMass":"269 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d⁶ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,14,2],"densityRT":"~41 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 400 °C","boilingPointC":"~7 000 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

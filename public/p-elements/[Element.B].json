{"description":"Boron is a metalloid with properties between metals and nonmetals, known for forming strong, heat-resistant compounds. Boron is essential in borosilicate glass, fiberglass, ceramics, and detergents. In agriculture, small amounts of boron support plant growth. Its ability to absorb neutrons makes boron important for nuclear shielding and control rods. Although rarely found in pure form, its compounds are widespread and versatile. Boron’s role in materials science continues to expand, especially in reinforced composites and modern electronics.","name":"Boron","symbol":"B","atomicNumber":"5","period":"2","group":"13","atomicMass":"10.81 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p¹","energyLevels":[2,3],"densityRT":"2.46 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"2.37 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"2 076 °C","boilingPointC":"3 927 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"11.1 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"4.6 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Seaborgium is a synthetic transactinide named after Glenn T. Seaborg, a key figure in actinide research. It is created through high-energy fusion reactions and exists only for fractions of a second. Despite these limits, scientists have observed behavior consistent with tungsten, supporting theoretical predictions. Seaborgium provides valuable data for understanding chemical stability and bonding in the superheavy region. Though unusable outside research, it plays an important role in testing quantum models that account for relativistic effects in very heavy atoms.","name":"Seaborgium","symbol":"Sg","atomicNumber":"106","period":"7","group":"6","atomicMass":"269 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d⁴ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,12,2],"densityRT":"~35 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 100 °C","boilingPointC":"~6 100 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

{"description":"Fluorine is an extremely reactive pale-yellow gas and the most electronegative element. It forms strong bonds used in polymers, refrigerants, and specialized chemicals. Fluoride compounds help strengthen tooth enamel and are added to many dental products. In industry, fluorine enables production of Teflon and other high-performance materials. Because it reacts violently with most substances, it requires strict handling and specialized equipment. Its unmatched reactivity makes fluorine both challenging and valuable in chemical and industrial applications.","name":"Fluorine","symbol":"F","atomicNumber":"9","period":"2","group":"17","atomicMass":"18.998 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p⁵","energyLevels":[2,7],"densityRT":"0.001696 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.505 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-219.7 °C","boilingPointC":"-188.1 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"31.3 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"17.1 cm³/mol"}

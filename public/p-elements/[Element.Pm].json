{"description":"Promethium is a rare radioactive metal that does not occur naturally in significant amounts. It is mainly produced in nuclear reactors and used in specialized lighting, signal markers, and research devices. Promethium-based materials can generate light without external power, making them useful in certain safety applications. Although its radioactivity requires strict handling procedures, promethium remains important in niche scientific and technological fields.","name":"Promethium","symbol":"Pm","atomicNumber":"61","period":"6","group":"— (Lanthanide)","atomicMass":"145 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f⁵ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,23,8,2],"densityRT":"7.22 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"1 100 °C","boilingPointC":"3 000 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

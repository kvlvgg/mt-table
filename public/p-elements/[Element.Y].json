{"description":"Yttrium is a rare-earth metal used in phosphors, lasers, and high-strength alloys. Its compounds help produce bright red colors in displays and improve performance in superconducting materials. Yttrium-stabilized ceramics withstand high temperatures and mechanical stress. Although not found pure in nature, it is extracted from rare-earth minerals. Its unique combination of optical and structural properties supports many advanced technologies.","name":"Yttrium","symbol":"Y","atomicNumber":"39","period":"5","group":"3","atomicMass":"88.90584 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹ 5s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,9,2],"densityRT":"4.47 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"1 526 °C","boilingPointC":"3 338 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.53 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"19.9 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Copernicium is a superheavy synthetic element named after Nicolaus Copernicus. It exhibits unusual predicted properties, including possible gaseous behavior at room temperature due to relativistic effects. Experimental chemistry has shown limited but intriguing patterns suggesting similarities to mercury. Copernicium helps researchers explore the boundary between metals and noble gases within the superheavy region. While it has no applications outside research, it provides valuable insight into how extreme atomic numbers alter physical and chemical behavior.","name":"Copernicium","symbol":"Cn","atomicNumber":"112","period":"7","group":"12","atomicMass":"285 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,2],"densityRT":"~14 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~283 °C","boilingPointC":"~357 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

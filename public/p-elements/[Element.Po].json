{"description":"Polonium is a rare, highly radioactive element with only a few specialized applications. It emits intense alpha radiation, which makes it useful in static eliminators and certain space technologies requiring compact heat sources. Handling polonium demands strict radiological safety protocols, as exposure can be lethal even in tiny amounts. The element was first discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, and its rarity in nature makes it challenging to obtain. Today, polonium is typically produced in nuclear reactors. While it has limited practical use, it plays an important role in research areas involving radiation, nuclear reactions, and advanced material studies.","name":"Polonium","symbol":"Po","atomicNumber":"84","period":"6","group":"16","atomicMass":"209 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p⁴","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,6],"densityRT":"9.20 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"8.9 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"254 °C","boilingPointC":"962 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.4","molarVolume":"22.⁴/undefined"}

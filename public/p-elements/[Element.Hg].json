{"description":"Mercury is a dense, silvery liquid metal at room temperature. It has been used in thermometers, switches, and scientific instruments. Due to toxicity concerns, many applications have been phased out or replaced with safer alternatives. Still, mercury remains important in certain industrial processes and research contexts. Its unusual liquid state and conductive properties make it scientifically interesting despite its hazards.","name":"Mercury","symbol":"Hg","atomicNumber":"80","period":"6","group":"12","atomicMass":"200.59 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,2],"densityRT":"13.53 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"13.69 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-38.83 °C","boilingPointC":"356.73 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.98 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"14.09 cm³/mol"}

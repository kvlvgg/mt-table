{"description":"Californium is a powerful neutron emitter, making it one of the most practically useful synthetic elements. Small amounts appear in neutron sources used for detecting explosives, analyzing materials, and starting nuclear reactors. Its strong radioactivity demands careful shielding, but the versatility of its neutron emissions gives it unique industrial and research applications. Californium’s production is complex and expensive, requiring long irradiation periods in specialized reactors. Despite its challenges, it remains a key tool in geology, medicine, and nuclear science, where precise neutron sources are essential. Its behavior also provides insight into transuranic chemistry and radioactive decay processes.","name":"Californium","symbol":"Cf","atomicNumber":"98","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"251 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁰ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,28,8,2],"densityRT":"15.1 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~14.3 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"900 °C","boilingPointC":"~1 470 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.3 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"15.1 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Phosphorus is a reactive nonmetal essential for life, forming DNA, ATP, and cellular membranes. It exists mainly as white and red phosphorus, each with distinct properties. Phosphates are crucial for fertilizers, supporting global food production. Industry uses phosphorus in detergents, flame retardants, and various chemical processes. Because of its reactivity, pure phosphorus must be stored carefully. Its biological importance and industrial versatility make phosphorus a key element in both natural and technological systems.","name":"Phosphorus","symbol":"P","atomicNumber":"15","period":"3","group":"15","atomicMass":"30.974 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ne] 3s² 3p³","energyLevels":[2,8,5],"densityRT":"1.82 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"44.1 °C","boilingPointC":"280.5 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"23.8 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"17.0 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Rutherfordium is the first of the transactinide elements and a highly radioactive metal synthesized in particle accelerators. Its short-lived isotopes allow only limited chemical study, yet researchers have confirmed its similarity to hafnium. Rutherfordium helps scientists examine how relativity affects electron behavior in heavy atoms, influencing periodic trends. Its properties provide clues about structural changes in the superheavy region of the table. While it has no industrial applications, rutherfordium is essential for experimental chemistry and theoretical modeling at the frontiers of element discovery.","name":"Rutherfordium","symbol":"Rf","atomicNumber":"104","period":"7","group":"4","atomicMass":"267 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d² 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,10,2],"densityRT":"~23 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 100 °C","boilingPointC":"~5 500 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

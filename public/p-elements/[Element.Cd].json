{"description":"Cadmium is a soft, bluish metal used in batteries, pigments, and corrosion-resistant coatings. It is best known for its role in nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. Because cadmium and its compounds can be toxic, usage is carefully regulated. Despite these concerns, cadmium remains important in specialized industrial processes and certain high-stability applications where alternatives are less effective.","name":"Cadmium","symbol":"Cd","atomicNumber":"48","period":"5","group":"12","atomicMass":"112.414 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18,2],"densityRT":"8.65 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"7.99 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"321.07 °C","boilingPointC":"767 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.02 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"13.0 cm³/mol"}

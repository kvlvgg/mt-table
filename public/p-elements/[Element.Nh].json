{"description":"Nihonium is a synthetic element discovered through international collaboration. Its isotopes decay rapidly, leaving little opportunity for experimentation. Nihonium is theorized to behave somewhat like thallium, though deviations are expected due to relativistic influences. It holds symbolic significance as one of the few elements named after a geographical region (Japan). Its scientific value lies primarily in confirming nuclear reaction pathways and studying superheavy element formation.","name":"Nihonium","symbol":"Nh","atomicNumber":"113","period":"7","group":"13","atomicMass":"286 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,3],"densityRT":"~16 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~430 °C","boilingPointC":"~1 130 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

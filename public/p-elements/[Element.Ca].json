{"description":"Calcium is a reactive metal crucial for living organisms, forming bones, shells, and structural components of cells. Its compounds, such as limestone and gypsum, are widespread in construction and manufacturing. Calcium ions regulate muscle contraction, nerve function, and many metabolic processes. Industrial uses include cement production, metallurgy, and water treatment. Despite its reactivity in pure form, calcium compounds are stable and widely used, making the element vital to both biological and technological systems.","name":"Calcium","symbol":"Ca","atomicNumber":"20","period":"4","group":"2","atomicMass":"40.078 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,8,2],"densityRT":"1.55 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.378 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"842 °C","boilingPointC":"1 484 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.9 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"29.9 cm³/mol"}

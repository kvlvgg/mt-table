{"description":"Potassium is a soft, reactive metal essential for plant growth and biological function. Its ions play a central role in nerve signaling, fluid regulation, and cellular energy processes. In agriculture, potassium compounds are major components of fertilizers. Industry uses potassium salts in glassmaking, soap production, and various chemical applications. Because metallic potassium reacts vigorously with water, it must be handled with care, but its compounds remain indispensable across many fields.","name":"Potassium","symbol":"K","atomicNumber":"19","period":"4","group":"1","atomicMass":"39.098 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 4s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,8,1],"densityRT":"0.862 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.828 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"63.5 °C","boilingPointC":"759 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"29.6 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"45.3 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Thorium is a mildly radioactive metal more abundant than uranium and known for its potential role in next-generation nuclear reactors. Thorium-based fuel cycles promise cleaner waste profiles and enhanced safety, attracting interest from energy researchers. Historically, thorium appeared in gas mantles, specialty alloys, and high-temperature ceramics. Its chemical behavior resembles that of other actinides but with greater stability. Although thorium requires careful handling, its long-term radioactivity is significantly lower than many nuclear materials. Ongoing research explores its viability as a sustainable energy source, making thorium a notable candidate for future reactor technologies and advanced materials development.","name":"Thorium","symbol":"Th","atomicNumber":"90","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"232.0377 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 6d² 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,10,2],"densityRT":"11.7 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~11.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 750 °C","boilingPointC":"4 788 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.23 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"19.9 cm³/mol"}

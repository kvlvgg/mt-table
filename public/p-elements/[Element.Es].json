{"description":"Einsteinium is a highly radioactive synthetic element named after Albert Einstein. It is produced in minute quantities during nuclear explosions or prolonged reactor irradiation. Because it decays quickly and is extremely difficult to isolate, its chemistry is not fully explored. Einsteinium is used mainly for creating other heavy elements, particularly fermium and mendelevium. Its intense radioactivity complicates experiments, often damaging the materials used to contain it. While it has no practical applications outside research, einsteinium offers rare opportunities to study the physics and chemistry of very heavy atoms, pushing the limits of what can be observed in the laboratory.","name":"Einsteinium","symbol":"Es","atomicNumber":"99","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"252 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹¹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,29,8,2],"densityRT":"~8.84 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~8.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"860 °C","boilingPointC":"— °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~25 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"28.5 cm³/mol"}

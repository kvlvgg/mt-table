{"description":"Europium is a soft metal with notable luminescent properties. It is widely used in display screens, fluorescent lamps, and security markings. Europium-based phosphors create bright red and blue hues in LEDs and TV panels. Although relatively rare and reactive, europium plays a crucial role in high-quality lighting and anti-counterfeiting technologies thanks to its reliable light-emission characteristics.","name":"Europium","symbol":"Eu","atomicNumber":"63","period":"6","group":"— (Lanthanide)","atomicMass":"151.96 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f⁷ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,25,8,2],"densityRT":"5.24 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"826 °C","boilingPointC":"1 529 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.66 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"28.97 cm³/mol"}

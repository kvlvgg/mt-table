{"description":"Antimony is a brittle metalloid used in flame retardants, semiconductors, and specialized alloys. When combined with lead, it increases hardness and durability, making it valuable for batteries and metal components. Antimony compounds also appear in pigments and ceramics. Although toxic in some forms, controlled applications make use of its distinctive chemical behavior. Its versatility supports both traditional and modern technologies.","name":"Antimony","symbol":"Sb","atomicNumber":"51","period":"5","group":"15","atomicMass":"121.760 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p³","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18,5],"densityRT":"6.697 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"6.53 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"630.63 °C","boilingPointC":"1 587 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.23 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"18.2 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Fermium is a synthetic actinide discovered in the debris of early thermonuclear tests. It can only be produced in tiny amounts, making experimentation challenging. Fermium’s chemistry follows trends seen in other heavy actinides, but detailed study is limited by its scarcity and rapid decay. It is primarily used for scientific research involving nuclear reactions, neutron capture, and transuranic element behavior. Fermium helps scientists better understand the structure of heavy nuclei and contributes to predictions about elements that cannot yet be synthesized in measurable quantities. Though it lacks industrial use, fermium remains scientifically valuable.","name":"Fermium","symbol":"Fm","atomicNumber":"100","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"257 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹² 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,30,8,2],"densityRT":"~9.7 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"1 527 °C","boilingPointC":"— °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~25 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"~24 cm³/mol"}

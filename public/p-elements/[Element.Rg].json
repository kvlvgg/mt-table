{"description":"Roentgenium is a synthetic element named in honor of Wilhelm Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays. It is produced atom by atom in fusion reactions and decays almost instantly. While its chemistry is not well studied, it is expected to act like gold, with notable relativistic effects influencing its electron structure. Roentgenium contributes to research on nuclear stability and electron behavior in heavy elements. Its scientific role is centered on testing theoretical predictions in the upper reaches of the periodic table.","name":"Roentgenium","symbol":"Rg","atomicNumber":"111","period":"7","group":"11","atomicMass":"282 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,1],"densityRT":"~28 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~2 100 °C","boilingPointC":"~5 500 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

{"description":"Lead is a dense, malleable metal long used in construction, plumbing, and protective shielding. Its ability to block radiation makes it valuable in medical and industrial environments. Lead’s low melting point and ease of shaping supported its widespread adoption throughout history. However, its toxicity has led to strict regulations, drastically reducing its use in household products and fuel. Exposure to lead can harm the nervous system, especially in children. Modern applications often rely on lead in batteries, soldering alloys, and specialized materials where alternatives are less effective. Despite health concerns, lead remains relevant in controlled, safety-focused industries.","name":"Lead","symbol":"Pb","atomicNumber":"82","period":"6","group":"14","atomicMass":"207.2 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,4],"densityRT":"11.34 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"327.46 °C","boilingPointC":"1 749 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.65 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"18.26 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Dysprosium is a rare-earth metal prized for its strong magnetic properties and ability to maintain stability at high temperatures. It is vital in high-performance magnets used in electric vehicles, robotics, and wind turbines. Dysprosium also appears in certain reactor control materials. Its scarcity and growing demand make it one of the more strategically important rare-earth elements.","name":"Dysprosium","symbol":"Dy","atomicNumber":"66","period":"6","group":"— (Lanthanide)","atomicMass":"162.50 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁰ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,28,8,2],"densityRT":"8.54 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"1 412 °C","boilingPointC":"2 567 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.70 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"19.01 cm³/mol"}

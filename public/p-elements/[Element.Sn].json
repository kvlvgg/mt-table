{"description":"Tin is a versatile metal known for coating other metals to prevent corrosion. It appears in solder, packaging, and alloys such as bronze. Tin’s low melting point and non-toxic nature make it useful in food-grade applications and electronics. Historically important in tools and trade, tin remains essential in modern manufacturing. Its ability to bond with other metals keeps it central to many industrial processes.","name":"Tin","symbol":"Sn","atomicNumber":"50","period":"5","group":"14","atomicMass":"118.710 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,18,4],"densityRT":"7.31 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"6.99 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"231.93 °C","boilingPointC":"2 602 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"27.11 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"16.3 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Nickel is a corrosion-resistant metal widely used in stainless steel, alloys, and plating. It provides strength, durability, and resistance to high temperatures. Nickel-based alloys appear in turbines, electronics, and chemical equipment. The metal also plays a major role in rechargeable batteries, particularly in lithium-ion technologies. While some people may be sensitive to nickel contact, its industrial usefulness remains vast and well-established.","name":"Nickel","symbol":"Ni","atomicNumber":"28","period":"4","group":"10","atomicMass":"58.693 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d⁸ 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,16,2],"densityRT":"8.908 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"7.81 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 455 °C","boilingPointC":"2 913 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.1 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"6.6 cm³/mol"}

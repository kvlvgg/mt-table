{"description":"Livermorium is a synthetic element named for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Its isotopes are short-lived, restricting chemical study. Theoretically, livermorium resembles polonium, though its heavy atomic mass may lead to deviations in reactivity. Scientists investigate livermorium to better understand nuclear shell structure and trends among the heaviest chalcogens. It has no industrial use but contributes to foundational research on atomic stability.","name":"Livermorium","symbol":"Lv","atomicNumber":"116","period":"7","group":"16","atomicMass":"293 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p⁴","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,6],"densityRT":"~12.9 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~400 °C","boilingPointC":"~1 100 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

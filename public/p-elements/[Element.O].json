{"description":"Oxygen is a highly reactive gas essential for combustion, respiration, and countless chemical transformations. It forms water, oxides, minerals, and is vital for most life on Earth. Industry uses oxygen in metal cutting, steelmaking, medical therapies, and wastewater treatment. Because of its ability to support burning and biological energy production, oxygen influences nearly every environmental and technological system. Despite being abundant in the atmosphere, its reactive forms require careful use. Oxygen’s importance spans from everyday biological function to advanced industrial applications.","name":"Oxygen","symbol":"O","atomicNumber":"8","period":"2","group":"16","atomicMass":"15.999 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p⁴","energyLevels":[2,6],"densityRT":"0.001429 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.141 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-218.8 °C","boilingPointC":"-182.9 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"29.4 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"14.0 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Technetium is a radioactive metal and the first element produced artificially. Because it is not found naturally in significant amounts, it is mainly used in medical imaging, especially in diagnostic scans. Technetium’s compounds also help prevent corrosion in industrial systems. Despite its radioactivity, controlled use in medicine has made it one of the most important isotopes for diagnostic procedures.","name":"Technetium","symbol":"Tc","atomicNumber":"43","period":"5","group":"7","atomicMass":"98 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Kr] 4d⁵ 5s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,13,2],"densityRT":"11.0 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"2 157 °C","boilingPointC":"4 262 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.27 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"8.5 cm³/mol"}

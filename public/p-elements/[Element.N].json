{"description":"Nitrogen is a colorless, inert gas making up most of Earth’s atmosphere. Although unreactive in its molecular form, nitrogen becomes highly valuable when converted into compounds such as ammonia and nitrates. These are essential for fertilizers, enabling large-scale agriculture. Nitrogen is used to create inert environments, preserve food, and cool systems through liquid nitrogen. In biology, nitrogen forms the basis of proteins and DNA. Its stable atmospheric presence and reactive potential in compounds make it fundamental to both natural cycles and industrial processes.","name":"Nitrogen","symbol":"N","atomicNumber":"7","period":"2","group":"15","atomicMass":"14.007 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p³","energyLevels":[2,5],"densityRT":"0.0012506 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.807 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-210.0 °C","boilingPointC":"-195.8 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"29.1 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"13.5 cm³/mol"}

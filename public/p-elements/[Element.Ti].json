{"description":"Titanium is a strong, lightweight metal known for its exceptional corrosion resistance. It is widely used in aerospace engineering, medical implants, chemical processing, and high-performance equipment. Titanium forms a protective oxide layer that prevents rust, even in harsh environments. Its strength-to-weight ratio makes it ideal for applications where durability and low mass are essential. Although difficult to extract, titanium’s reliability and biocompatibility justify its extensive use in advanced industries.","name":"Titanium","symbol":"Ti","atomicNumber":"22","period":"4","group":"4","atomicMass":"47.867 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d² 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,10,2],"densityRT":"4.506 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"4.11 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 668 °C","boilingPointC":"3 287 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.1 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"10.6 cm³/mol"}

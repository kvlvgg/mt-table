{"description":"Thallium is a soft, highly toxic metal with a history of industrial use in electronics, optics, and specialized glass. It forms compounds that can influence electrical conductivity, making it useful in certain semiconductors and infrared detectors. Despite its practical value, thallium must be handled with extreme caution due to its ability to interfere with biological processes. In small amounts, it can be absorbed through the skin, raising significant safety concerns. Thallium’s chemical behavior resembles that of lead and mercury, and many of its applications have been reduced as industries shift toward safer alternatives. Today, it remains important mainly in niche research and instrumentation.","name":"Thallium","symbol":"Tl","atomicNumber":"81","period":"6","group":"13","atomicMass":"204.38 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,18,3],"densityRT":"11.85 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"304 °C","boilingPointC":"1 473 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"26.32 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"17.20 cm³/mol"}

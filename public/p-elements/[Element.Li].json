{"description":"Lithium is a soft, silvery metal and the lightest solid element. It reacts easily with water and air, forming compounds widely used in modern technologies. Lithium plays a crucial role in rechargeable batteries, powering smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Its salts are also used in ceramics, glass production, and certain medical treatments. Because of its high electrochemical potential, lithium enables efficient energy storage, making it vital in renewable-energy systems. Though reactive, the metal is relatively easy to process and transport when properly contained. Continued growth in battery demand has made lithium one of the most strategically important resources.","name":"Lithium","symbol":"Li","atomicNumber":"3","period":"2","group":"1","atomicMass":"6.94 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s¹","energyLevels":[2,1],"densityRT":"0.534 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.512 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"180.5 °C","boilingPointC":"1 342 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.9 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"13.1 cm³/mol"}

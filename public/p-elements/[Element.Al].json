{"description":"Aluminum is a lightweight, corrosion-resistant metal widely used in construction, packaging, and transportation. Its natural oxide layer protects it from rust, while its malleability allows easy shaping. Aluminum alloys appear in aircraft, vehicles, and structural components. It is also highly recyclable, making it important for sustainable manufacturing. Despite being abundant in Earth’s crust, pure aluminum requires significant energy to extract, but its long service life and recyclability balance these costs.","name":"Aluminium","symbol":"Al","atomicNumber":"13","period":"3","group":"13","atomicMass":"26.982 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ne] 3s² 3p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,3],"densityRT":"2.70 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"2.375 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"660.3 °C","boilingPointC":"2 519 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.2 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"10.0 cm³/mol"}

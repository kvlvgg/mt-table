{"description":"Iron is one of the most abundant and historically significant metals. It forms the basis of steel, the backbone of modern construction, transportation, and manufacturing. Iron’s magnetic properties and versatility enable its use in tools, machinery, electronics, and everyday objects. In biology, iron is crucial for oxygen transport through hemoglobin. Despite susceptibility to rust, protective alloys and coatings extend its durability. Iron’s central role in industry and life makes it one of the most important elements.","name":"Iron","symbol":"Fe","atomicNumber":"26","period":"4","group":"8","atomicMass":"55.845 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d⁶ 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,14,2],"densityRT":"7.874 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"6.98 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 538 °C","boilingPointC":"2 862 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.1 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"7.1 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Americium is a synthetic radioactive metal commonly recognized for its use in household smoke detectors, where tiny amounts of americium-241 enable ionizing sensors. It is produced in nuclear reactors by neutron capture in plutonium. Beyond consumer devices, americium is important in research involving neutron sources and advanced materials. Its radioactivity demands careful management, but its predictable decay characteristics make it useful in controlled settings. Americium’s chemistry contributes to understanding the broader actinide series and transuranic behavior. Although not abundant, it remains valuable across specialized scientific applications and helps illustrate how synthetic elements can become practically significant.","name":"Americium","symbol":"Am","atomicNumber":"95","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"243 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f⁷ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,25,8,2],"densityRT":"12.0 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~11.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 176 °C","boilingPointC":"2 607 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"62.7 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"20.8 cm³/mol"}

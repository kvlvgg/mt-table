{"description":"Lawrencium is a synthetic element marking the transition between actinides and the superheavy elements. Produced one atom at a time, it exhibits fleeting existence due to its rapid decay. Lawrencium’s electron configuration has sparked scientific debate, as it challenges expected periodic trends. Its study helps refine the theoretical structure of the periodic table, especially the positioning and properties of heavy elements. While its chemistry is difficult to observe, experiments indicate that lawrencium behaves somewhat differently from other actinides. It has no practical uses, but it remains important for understanding the limits of atomic behavior and periodic organization.","name":"Lawrencium","symbol":"Lr","atomicNumber":"103","period":"7","group":"3","atomicMass":"262 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 7s² 7p¹","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,8,3],"densityRT":"~14.4 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~1 620 °C","boilingPointC":"— °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"—"}

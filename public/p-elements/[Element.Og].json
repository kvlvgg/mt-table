{"description":"Oganesson is currently the heaviest known element, named after Yuri Oganessian. Its extreme atomic mass and strong relativistic effects give it highly unusual predicted properties, including possible behavior closer to a noble gas–solid hybrid than a classical gas. Oganesson’s isotopes decay almost instantly, limiting experimental study. It represents the frontier of the periodic table, offering clues to the theoretical “island of stability” and the nature of matter under extreme conditions. While it has no practical applications, oganesson stands as a milestone in nuclear science and the ongoing effort to understand the limits of atomic structure.","name":"Oganesson","symbol":"Og","atomicNumber":"118","period":"7","group":"18","atomicMass":"294 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f¹⁴ 6d¹⁰ 7s² 7p⁶","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,32,18,8],"densityRT":"~7.0 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"~50 °C","boilingPointC":"~80 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"—","molarVolume":"~40 cm³/mol"}

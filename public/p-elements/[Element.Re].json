{"description":"Rhenium is a rare, high-melting-point metal used in superalloys for jet engines and industrial turbines. It enhances heat resistance and mechanical strength in extreme environments. Rhenium also appears in catalysts for chemical reactions. Its rarity and demanding extraction process make it expensive, yet essential for certain high-performance materials.","name":"Rhenium","symbol":"Re","atomicNumber":"75","period":"6","group":"7","atomicMass":"186.21 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d⁵ 6s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,13,2],"densityRT":"21.02 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"3 186 °C","boilingPointC":"5 596 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.48 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"8.85 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Plutonium is a highly radioactive metal central to nuclear energy and weapons technology. It forms multiple allotropes, each with distinct physical properties, complicating its use and storage. Plutonium-239 is especially important for sustaining nuclear reactions. Strict safety and security measures govern all handling and transport due to its long-term radioactivity. Beyond reactors, plutonium powers some deep-space missions through radioisotope generators. Its behavior in the environment is closely monitored to prevent contamination. While its history is controversial, plutonium remains a crucial material for both energy research and space exploration, demonstrating the dual-use nature of advanced nuclear technology.","name":"Plutonium","symbol":"Pu","atomicNumber":"94","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"244 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f⁶ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,24,8,2],"densityRT":"19.8 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"16.6 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"639 °C","boilingPointC":"3 228 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"35.5 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"12.3 cm³/mol"}

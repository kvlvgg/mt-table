{"description":"Neon is a noble gas known for its bright red-orange glow in electrical discharge tubes. It is chemically inert, forming no known stable compounds. Neon is used in lighting, high-voltage indicators, and cryogenic refrigeration. Its low boiling point makes it effective for specialized cooling systems. Although rare in Earth’s atmosphere, neon is long-lasting and requires minimal maintenance once installed in lighting setups. Its distinct color and stability have made it iconic in signs and displays.","name":"Neon","symbol":"Ne","atomicNumber":"10","period":"2","group":"18","atomicMass":"20.180 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[He] 2s² 2p⁶","energyLevels":[2,8],"densityRT":"0.0008999 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"1.204 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-248.6 °C","boilingPointC":"-246.1 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"20.8 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"16.7 cm³/mol"}

{"description":"Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, forming the basis of many natural and industrial processes. It appears in water, organic compounds, and plays a key role in biological chemistry. Industry uses hydrogen for ammonia production, fuel processing, and exploring cleaner energy solutions. Despite its simple atomic structure, hydrogen shows diverse behavior, existing as atoms, molecules, or plasma. Its high reactivity requires careful handling, yet it remains essential for research and technology. With growing interest in sustainable energy, hydrogen is increasingly viewed as a promising component of future energy systems.","name":"Hydrogen","symbol":"H","atomicNumber":"1","period":"1","group":"1","atomicMass":"1.008 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"1s¹","energyLevels":[1],"densityRT":"0.00008988 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.0708 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"-259.1 °C","boilingPointC":"-252.9 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"28.8 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"14.1 cm³/mol"}

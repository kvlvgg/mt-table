{"description":"Scandium is a lightweight metal often classified as a rare-earth element due to its similar chemical properties. It improves the strength and heat resistance of aluminum alloys, making them valuable in aerospace and high-performance sports equipment. Scandium is also used in lighting, particularly in metal-halide lamps that produce bright, natural-looking light. Although not widely abundant, its unique properties make it important for specialized technologies. Careful extraction and processing ensure efficient use of this rare and valuable element.","name":"Scandium","symbol":"Sc","atomicNumber":"21","period":"4","group":"3","atomicMass":"44.956 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d¹ 4s²","energyLevels":[2,8,9,2],"densityRT":"2.985 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"2.80 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"1 541 °C","boilingPointC":"2 836 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"25.5 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"15.0 cm³/mol"}

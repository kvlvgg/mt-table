{"description":"Helium is an inert, lightweight noble gas known for its chemical stability and extremely low boiling point. It forms no natural compounds and exists mainly as isolated atoms. Helium is used in cryogenics, gas chromatography, and as a cooling medium for superconducting magnets. Because it is lighter than air and non-flammable, it is also used in balloons and airships. Its unique quantum properties lead to superfluid behavior at very low temperatures. Although abundant in the universe, helium on Earth is limited, obtained mostly from natural gas deposits. Its scarcity makes careful management and recycling especially important.","name":"Helium","symbol":"He","atomicNumber":"2","period":"1","group":"18","atomicMass":"4.002602 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"1s²","energyLevels":[2],"densityRT":"0.0001785 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"0.125 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"— °C","boilingPointC":"-268.9 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"20.8 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"27.6 cm³/mol"}

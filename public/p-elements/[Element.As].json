{"description":"Arsenic is a metalloid known for its toxicity, yet it has controlled uses in industry and electronics. Arsenic compounds are used in semiconductors, wood preservatives, and specialized alloys. Historically associated with poisons, arsenic must be handled carefully to avoid contamination. Despite its hazards, its distinct chemical behavior provides value in specific controlled applications, particularly in advanced materials and microelectronics.","name":"Arsenic","symbol":"As","atomicNumber":"33","period":"4","group":"15","atomicMass":"74.922 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p³","energyLevels":[2,8,18,5],"densityRT":"5.72 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"—","meltingPointC":"Sublimes at 615 °C","boilingPointC":"613 (sublimes) °C","molarHeatCapacity":"24.64 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"13.1 cm³/mol"}

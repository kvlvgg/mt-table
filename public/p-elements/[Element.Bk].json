{"description":"Berkelium is a synthetic radioactive metal produced in extremely small quantities within nuclear reactors. Its rarity and intense radioactivity limit its use almost entirely to scientific research. Berkelium plays an important role in the study of heavy-element chemistry, particularly as a stepping stone for creating even heavier transuranic elements. Its behavior helps scientists understand trends across the actinide series, especially regarding electron configurations and oxidation states. Handling berkelium requires strict radiological controls, making it suitable only for specialized facilities. While it has no industrial applications, its scientific value lies in advancing nuclear chemistry and exploring the boundaries of the periodic table.","name":"Berkelium","symbol":"Bk","atomicNumber":"97","period":"7","group":"Actinide","atomicMass":"247 g/mol","electronConfiguration":"[Rn] 5f⁹ 7s²","energyLevels":[2,8,18,32,27,8,2],"densityRT":"14.78 g/cm³","densityLiquidAtMP":"~14.0 g/cm³","meltingPointC":"986 °C","boilingPointC":"2 627 °C","molarHeatCapacity":"~29 J/(mol·K)","molarVolume":"16.2 cm³/mol"}
